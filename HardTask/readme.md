Accept the number of test cases, t.
Create an array arr.
Create a while loop to run the program t times.
Create a variable c to count.
Input an integer from the user, n.
Start a loop from 0 to 2^n + 1.
In the loop check whether index ^ (index + 1) == (index + 2) ^ (index + 3), if the condition is true, increase the counter, c by 1.
After the for loop terminates,  Modulo the ouptut i.e  value of c by 100000007.
Display the value of c.
Note:- The time complexity of this program is too high.
