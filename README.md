I am Mihir Aman Raj. I am from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. My interest is in coding and learning new things about it everyday. I can code in java and python. I am currently learning Dynamic Programming. I completed the round 1 task question in python language because it is short and easy to understand. The only problem which I faced was in Biscuit problem, so i did it in java language.
