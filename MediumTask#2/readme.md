If the number accepted from the user is 0 or 1, return 1.
Else, Start a for i loop from 2 to n.
In the loop if n % i == 0 .Change the value of c to true.
Start a new if condition in else part if c == true increase the value of f by 1 else change the value of f = 9 then return f
In the main part start a loop from 0 to n.
Create a new variable prime
If returned value is 9 then increase the counter, t  by 1.
